    <h1>Do you think people  “Amateur Web design” that reading examplifies will ever come back in the future?</h1>
    
    <body>
    	<p>I think so, we've come a long way in terms of web design, where everything is very designed and percise, but I think the ameteur and vintage asthetic is making a huge comeback. Minimalism plays a role in this, where people aren't exactly looking for something beautiful, but rather something that they can easily read and access quickly. Amateur web design is quirky and fun, and I feel that the group of people who appreciate it is growing. Being able to look at something and say "hey, I know how they did that", and especially with the big push to teach children to code, that is going to become more popular.
