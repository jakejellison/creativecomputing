    	<p>Since I take a train fron New Jersey every day, my daily journey in New York City is quite brief. I exit the train at the 14th Street PATH station, and walk down 13th Street. I pass Mannes School of Music, the Biscuits and Bath Doggy Daycare place, and small restaurant. My journey always includes jaywalking accross the street about halfway, since Parsons is on the other side of the street. I love the thrill and rebellion I feel crossing the street, especially with cars speeding down the road. I pass a tavern, people waling their dogs, and finally arrive at Parsons. Hwoever, I always walk around the conter and enter via the Fifth Avenue entrance, because I like to see whats going on in the display space.</p>
    	<p>My path on a map is quite linear, but if you really zoom in, it starts very straight on one side of the street, quickly darts to the other side, and creates an L at the end of it. However, I would like to emphasize the speed of movement, considering I often stop to look at things, sometimes hesitate before I cross the street, or even speed up when I'm running late. Everything is the same, but the people and what they're doing is always different, and with this project I'd like to focus on how the experience changes throughout every step of the journey. I'm always very calm and curuous when I walk to school, I never feel rushed or overwhelmed, and really enjoy it, even when it's freezing cold and snowing. I want my website to reflect on that feeling, very simple and relaxing, but also constantly changing through evolution and movement.
